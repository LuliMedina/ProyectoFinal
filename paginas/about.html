						Sigrid began her career in 2013 by releasing her debut
						single, "Sun". The song was seen as her national
						breakthrough in Norway. She signed to Petroleum Records
						the following year, and performed at festivals such as
						Øyafestivalen. In 2016, Sigrid signed with Island
						Records. She released her debut single with Island,
						"Don't Kill My Vibe" in 2017. The EP achieved
						international success when it charted in Norway,
						Australia, and the United Kingdom.
					</p>

						She is also featured on the 2017 Justice League
						soundtrack, performing a cover of Leonard Cohen's 1988
						classic "Everybody Knows". In 2018, Sigrid was announced
						as the winner of BBC Music Sound of 2018. On 10 February
						2018, she was a guest presenter for an episode of The
						Playlist for CBBC. The same month, Sigrid won the
						Newcomer of the Year award at Spellemannprisen. She
						announced on Twitter that she would release a song
						called "Schedules" on 11 July 2018. The single was part
						of her second EP, titled Raw.

						In December 2018, Sigrid announced that her debut album
						Sucker Punch would be released on 8 March 2019. The
						album consists of 12 tracks, including five songs
						released prior to the album. In 2019, Sigrid will be
						touring with American band Maroon 5 for their Red Pill
						Blues Tour in Europe. She was also the support act for
						George Ezra's tour across the United Kingdom. In late
						2019, Sigrid will embark on a headline tour across
						Europe and North America to promote the release of
						Sucker Punch.
